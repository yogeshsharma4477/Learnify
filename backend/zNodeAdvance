Q. Clustering in Nodejs
> cluster of nodejs process can be used to run multiple instances of nodjes that can be distribute workloads amongs their apllication thread
// to handle traffic, can do load balancing at same time
 
    it is build in module
Q. how many worker thread you can create?
> as much as your computer has Cores
    with os module you can find that how many core your system has - os.cpus().length
    
    const cluster = require('node:cluster');
    if (cluster.isPrimary) {
        // it will create a cluster as much your system has
        for (let i = 0; i < os.cpus().length; i++) {
            cluster.fork(); // creating worker
        } 
    }
